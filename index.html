        <p>
          Iâ€™m currently interning at
          <a class="purple-link" href="https://hxouse.com/"> HXOUSE</a> as a
          Full Stack Developer. Most of the year, i'm doing my undergraduate in
          the Digital Futures program at OCAD University. I work daily to
          combine art and technology to create compelling
          <span class="nowrap">digital experiences.</span><br /><br />

          Last summer, I was apart of
          <a class="purple-link" href="https://www.jam3.com/"> Jam3</a> as a WE3
          developer intern where I ideated, pitched and built augmented reality
          experiences to partners <span class="nowrap">and clients.</span
          ><br /><br />

          Before that, I co-founded
          <a class="purple-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/projectcipher/">
            Project Cipher</a
          >, a non-for-profit that organized high school hackathons, and taught
          coding workshops in our community. <br /><br />

          In my free time, Iâ€™m currently teaching myself machine learning,
          probably scrapping this site again or playing Super Smash Bros
          Ultimate. <br /><br />
