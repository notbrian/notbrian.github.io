            <p>I’m currently doing my undergraduate in the Digital Futures program at OCAD University. I work daily to combine art and technology to create compelling experiences. <br><br>

Most recently, I was apart of <a class="purple-link" href="https://www.jam3.com/"> Jam3</a> as a WE3 developer intern where I ideated, pitched and built augmented reality experiences to partners and clients. <br><br>

Before that, I co-founded <a class="purple-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/projectcipher/"> Project Cipher</a>, a non-for-profit that organized high school hackathons, and taught coding workshops in our community. <br><br>

In my free time, I’m currently teaching myself machine learning, probably scrapping this site again or playing Super Smash Bros Ultimate. <br><br>
